# Scripts for the Dissertaion work of Jakob Schäfer

This script contains the code I used for my medical doctoral thesis. It was on the topic of "Correlation between spectroscopic attenuation of raw broadband ultrasound data collected with handheld devices and the Controlled Attenuation Parameter (CAP)". 
It is divided into the following sections:

## Data pipeline
Here, the raw ultrasound data output by the Clarius ultrasound devices are unpacked, anonymised and pre-processed so that they can be used afterwards.

## Attenuation parameter
This is where the calculation of the attenuation ultrasound parameters takes place. 

## Lizzi-Feleppa parameter
This is where the Lizzi-Feleppa ultrasound parameters are calculated. 

## Functions
Here are functions that I have written for overarching tasks. These can be accessed from all folders in this repository. See the import sections of the individual scripts.

## Other scripts
Additional scripts that cannot be assigned to the above folders are stored here.
These include, for example, scripts for visualising data or for statistical evaluation. 

## Bayesian optimizer
Scripts for optimising the input variables for the calculations are stored here. The optimisation is based on a Bayesian optimiser.
